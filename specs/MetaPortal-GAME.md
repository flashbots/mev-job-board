## $GAME index deployment - Impact arbitrage opportunities

### Description

MetaPortal are publicly launching their gaming index $GAME using the Set Protocol Asset Manager on 2nd March, 6pm UTC.

This creates an opportunity to arb between the [Uniswap V3 pool](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xb88abf1a4e06b43b86cc6b060424c74fe1d3e323) and the [Tokensets website](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/0xa1EA9aA32CBba8c203DDC510a144aD1F439d436c) where it is possible to mint/redeem the index for the underlying tokens

The Uniswap pool will have a fairly conservative range and swap fees will be set at 0.3%, so take that into account when calculating the opportunity.

### Difficulty

Easy to moderate?

### Is this a one-off opportunity or is it recurring?

4. Sell GAME into DEX pool for ETH.
5. ???
6. Profit
